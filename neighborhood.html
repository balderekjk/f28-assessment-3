      <p>
        I live in the vicinity of Waiehu. It is "makai", close to the ocean.
        Some people like to surf at a spot called "Churches". Many longtime
        local residents live in this area as well as many young families. There
        are some small family-run stores nearby. Some closed business due to
        COVID economy hit, but now they are coming back.

        Right outside of Waiehu, early into Kahului Beach Road, nearing the
        harbor entrance. The best Katsu maybe in all of Hawaii among other
        amazing chicken/pork plates. Natural ingredients.
